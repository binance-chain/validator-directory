CertiK is proud to announce the launch of our BNB Chain validator node, marking a new milestone in our partnership by furthering the creation of a secure staking ecosystem.

## Why CertiK Qualify?
CertiK has established and flourished a security focused partnership with BSC since day one, providing support to many high-quality projects in the BSC ecosystem. With a team of in-house security experts to ensure validator health and security,we will become a reliable validator for the BSC community.  

Some advantages of our security-first staking infrastructure design:  
-   Multi-Layered protections to prevent node attacks
-   Maintenance of node stability and uptime whilst eliminating slashing & other penalties
-   Balance between technical and business insights

## Ecosystem Contributions
All the staking rewards will be used for Research & Development efforts of Security Leaderboard and Skynet, paving the way for delivering more premium and robust security offerings. Ultimately; they will serve to improve the security of the wider blockchain ecosystem as a whole.

We’ve been running the BSC-oriented Security Leaderboard, providing data and intelligence for the community to interact with BSC more smoothly and securely. We’re set to enhance the security guarantees of the ever-flourishing BSC ecosystems!
