# Dora Factory

Public Goods Staking, or PGS, is a Dora Factory innovation wherein validator rewards get funneled back into the ecosystem rather than extracted as a typical validator commission. A PGS validator uses 70% of the commission fees to sponsor grants, hackathon prizes, bounty rewards, and ecosystem funding opportunities specifically for BNB Chain developers and teams developing frontier technologies. 30% of the commission fee is used to cover operating expenses + overhead, but this validator is truly operated in a not-for-profit nature.

PGS validators provide an everlasting source of funding for ecosystem developers, regardless of external market conditions, which helps ensure the sustainability of chain activity and long-term growth. These developer incentives will be available to all BNB Chain community members on the DoraHacks platform.

## Ecosystem Contributions

To enhance transparency and accountability, our DevOps team is capable of deploying a BNB Chain “GrantDAO” on-chain. This establishes a continuous funding source for developers, who can receive grants from a quadratic matching pool. One recent GrantDAO success story includes the Aptos GrantDAO, where we have distributed 38,000 APT tokens to 40+ teams who are actively contributing to the Aptos ecosystem. It also includes Dora’s recent Injective hackathon, where 100% of the $75,000 USD prize pool was contributed with a Dora Factory PGS validator.

In our efforts to ensure optimal node performance on BSC, our team has been engaging with multiple existing validators to gain insights and understand the appropriate configuration required. To guarantee the high availability and capability of our node, we will assemble a team of five DevOps engineers, each situated in different time zones. This strategic distribution enables us to provide maximum coverage, ensuring prompt response and resolution of any network-related issues.

Other mainnets that we validate:
Aptos, Agoric, Archway, Cardano, Klaytn, Cosmos Hub, Neutron, Evmos, Injective, Noble, AssetMantle, Cronos, Nolus, Stargaze

Other testnets that we validate:
SEI, Babylon chain, Zetachain, Althea Network, Nibiru, Dymension, Denom & Noria, Nolus, Composable Finance, etc.
